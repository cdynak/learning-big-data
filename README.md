# Learning Big Data

Collection of snippets, experiments and notes which are the basis for the CARDS, PATHS and FRAGMENTS dedicated to that subject.

It focuses on:
* hadoop
* distributed computation
* map reduce
* probabilistic algorithms
* databases
* spark (pyspark)
* ... many more (this list will be growing)

## Sections

This repository is composed of multiple sections where each one of them has some particular goal defined.

### Section: Map Reduce

Where we will be exploring, breaking, challenging Map Reduce paradigm. We will implement multiple Map Reduce engines as well as try many existing ones in order to be able to compare them based on what we learned along the way.

### Section: Towards SQL

Where we will explore the idea behind SQL languages (in general declarative vs imperative approaches) which will help us to understand design choices that must be made in order to create scalable solutions by limiting (not too much) scope of operations exposed to the end user.
